## Getting Started üöÄ

Follow these instructions to get a copy of RepoGPT up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (preferred package manager)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for database setup)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) with the [pgvector extension](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector)
- [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/) (for AI functionalities)

## Installation Guide üì¶

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbarinov/repogpt.git
cd repogpt
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Set Up PostgreSQL with pgvector

To leverage AI capabilities, RepoGPT uses PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension. Use Docker to set up the database:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name pgvector \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=repogpt \
  -p 5432:5432 \
  ankane/pgvector
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the following variables:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/repogpt
```

### 5. Initialize the Database Schema

Use Prisma to push the necessary database schema:

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

### 6. Build and Start the Application

To build and start the app, run:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

### 7. Access the Application

Once running, the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can now start managing and interacting with your repositories via RepoGPT.

## Usage üìù

### Import Your First Repository

Use the following command to import a repository:

* Set the OpenAI API key and Github Access Token. http://localhost:3000/settings
* Navigate to the **Repositories** section. http://localhost:3000/repositories
* Fill in the repository URL, repository branch name and click on the **Import** button.
* The repository will be imported and available for interaction in a few minutes.


### Interact with Your Repository

- Navigate to the **Chat** section to start a conversation with your codebase.
- Ask questions like "How is the authentication implemented?" or "List all the endpoints in the API."
